tsk_cc_dec;Reclaim Bear Island;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc_dec_desc;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.1;Invasion of Bear Island!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.1;The Ironborn could be aptly described as close kin to weeds, if left unchecked they will slowly, but, surely overwhelm your garden. For centuries Bear Island has been contested between the Starks and the Glovers, more recently it was manned by man-at-arms from Deepwood Motte, that was until the Reavers from Orkmont arrived. Now House Stark enjoys a position of primacy among the northern Kings, and as such this southern incursion is the perfect opportunity to re-estabilish our control over the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.1;Assemble a fleet!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.11;Dark wings, dark words, we received word that the Kings of Winter begun amassing strenght at Winterfell intent on taking our islands in the Bay of Ice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.11;Summon the Captains!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.111;After a bloodly struggle we finally managed to beat the ironman from Bear Island, now we must fortify and aptly man the island so that our western shores remain steadfast in its defence.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.111;You hear great feats from one House Mormont, maybe they should man the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.111;Maybe i should ponder over this some more.;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc2_dec;The White Knife problem;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc2_dec_desc;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.2;The Starks from The White Knife;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2;Since the Boltons sought protection from the Andals in Winterfell, our dominion over much of the North became a matter of great alarm to the nobles and petty Kings north of the Neck, of all the discontent nobility most surprising of all are the Greystarks, once an offshoot of House Stark, this cadet branch clearly does not appreciate the newfound eminence of the Kings of Winter, to make matters worse disconforting news that they for some time have been scheming with the lords of the Dreadfort, leave us with no recourse but to wage war upon these unruly nobles.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2;We must strike first before the Boltons can reinforce their allies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.22;The warmongery of House Stark finally knocks in our doors, its been centuries since the Wolf gave this barren and wartorn piece of shore to us, and since then we only suffered under their yoke, no more, with our Boltons allies we will drive the bloodthirsty direwolf back to its lair!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.22;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.222;Dark wings, dark words. A raven arrivied from the White Knife, House Stark finally decided to march on their unruly offshoot, this is the chance we been waiting, the andal invasion is over and we need no more meddling from Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.222;Call the Banners;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2222;The White Knife once again falls under the Stark banner, and with it our control over the North solidify, its true that rebellion stirred first close at home, but it was reinforced by House Bolton, which was permitted to keep most of its dominions and titles once they submited, but, now its clear that was a mistake, our troops will need to endure another campaing if there is to be peace in the North.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2222;Maybe we should style ourselfs King in the North...;;;;;;;;;x
dreadfort_subjugation;We march to the Dreadfort!;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc3_dec;War for the Neck;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc3_dec_desc;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.3;The Crannogmen;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.3;House Stark has recently vanquished or subjugate most threats, external or internal, to its rule in the North, conquering lands in the west, as well as the east, while its northern borders count with the assuring sight of the Wall, there is still one causeway open to the heart of our dominion, the Neck, located south of Winterfell, these swamps and bogs, said to be the result of a misshap in an ancient ritual held by the Children, prove a mighty natural fortress to the crannogmen, soon it will prove a mighty natural defence to the North.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.3;I heard some crannogmen ride lizard-lions to war!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.33;Some hunters awhile back came to us with tall-tales of armies converging north of the swamps, then we did not pay much cara to those news, if true at all, we tought it was just another petty squabble between northern Lords, but, as the direwolf banners of House Stark now enter our swamps their intentions are clear as day.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.33;To war!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.333;With the surrender of the Swamp King, one of the most geographical important locations of the North now falls under our control, and, with growing andal incursions plaguing all of Westeros, here we will make our stand, with the fortress of Moat Cailin, and now our swamps, we could easily throw back hosts ten times the size of our own.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.333;Maybe i should marry one of their princess...;;;;;;;;;x
crannog_marriage;It sure would help in bringing the crannogmen peacefully into the realm...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.333;Back to Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc4_dec;Resume building the Eyrie;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc4_dec_desc;King Roland Arryn, believing that the Gates of the Moon was vastly inferior to other castles and strategically vulnerable to raids from the mountain clans, started plans to build a new royal palace high in the mountain above the Gates of the Moon, it's up to you to finish it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.4;The Eyrie Halls;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.4;Since Roland I reign much need infrastructural progress has been made at the Eyrie, especially on the waycastles guarding the narrow stone steps leading to the only means of reaching your new castle, it's defences already formidable some of your household feel that it's time to transform these cold, unfinished halls into something worthy of House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].\n\nTo that end, the current hall set apart for receiving guests is a prime target for renovations, currently a crude thing, heavily masked with banners and tapestries hiding it's state of neglect, with some money and time, this could become a magnificent room, on pair of any of the Great Halls of Westeros...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.4;Remember the men to buy more silk with your colours...;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc44_dec;The Eyrie Towers;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc44_dec_desc;Acording to Roland I original plans contruction on one of the peaks of the Giant's Lance began by laying the foundations of seven slim towers, during building the Moon Tower and the Maiden's Tower have taken precendence over the other five, on account of being lodging for The Eyrie lord and his guest, respectively, while some progress has been made on the castle, it's high time serious investment in bring it to life is made...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.44;Plans have been finally laid out regarding the finishing of The Eyrie other 5 towers, the work will be expensive, a sept, godswood, expansions to the granary and new halls all will take a extreme toll on the realms finances, your castellan winces at any talk of extra expenses, but, you assure him it all will be worth it...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.44;More white marble will be needed...;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc444_dec;Finish The Eyrie;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc444_dec_desc;The castle is almost finished, some final decorations here and there and a new way of reaching the castle that does not involve climbing the handholds carved in the rock leading up from Sky are being discussed...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.444;Your master engineer guarantees you that this device will work, you look at it again, baskets and huge oaken buckets being pulled by winches, "Gods!", you think, it's the only real idea anyone has put foward as an alternative way to reach the Eyrie, and a needed one, as many of your vassals refuse visiting the almost finished castle thanks to its treacherous climb, seeing no other alternative you approve the construction...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.444;The castle is almost complete!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.41;Aparently the foreman has been hounding your castellan in regards of more funding, citing an endless list of necessities the man asks for more money each passing day, he also says that while money would speed things up new able bodied workers would just as well help with the contruction...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.41;Here's the coin, no more no less!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.41;Round up some of the smallfolk for work with promise of payment...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtsk_cc.41;Put some prisoners to work...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.42;Work on the Eyrie has stopped, what you and your men originaly set out to acomplish has been finished, now the only thing left to do is enjoy the fruit of your labours...;;;;;;;;;x
