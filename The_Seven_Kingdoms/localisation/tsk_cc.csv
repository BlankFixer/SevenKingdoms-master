EVTtitletsk_cc.1;Invasion of Bear Island!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.1;The Ironborn could be aptly described as close kin to weeds, if left unchecked they will slowly, but, surely overwhelm your garden. For centuries Bear Island has been contested between the Starks and the Glovers, more recently it was manned by man-at-arms from Deepwood Motte, that was until the Reavers from Orkmont arrived. Now House Stark enjoys a position of primacy among the northern Kings, and as such this southern incursion is the perfect opportunity to re-estabilish our control over the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.1;Assemble a fleet!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.11;Dark wings, dark words, we received word that the Kings of Winter begun amassing strenght at Winterfell intent on taking our islands in the Bay of Ice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.11;Summon the Captains!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.111;After a bloodly struggle we finally managed to beat the ironman from Bear Island, now we must fortify and aptly man the island so that our western shores remain steadfast in its defence.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.111;You hear great feats from one House Mormont, maybe they should man the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.111;Maybe i should ponder over this some more.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTtitletsk_cc.2;The Starks from The White Knife;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2;Since the Boltons sought protection from the Andals in Winterfell, our dominion over much of the North became a matter of great alarm to the nobles and petty Kings north of the Neck, of all the discontent nobility most surprising of all are the Greystarks, once an offshoot of House Stark, this cadet branch clearly does not appreciate the newfound eminence of the Kings of Winter, to make matters worse disconforting news that they for some time have been scheming with the lords of the Dreadfort, leave us with no recourse but to wage war upon these unruly nobles.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2;We must strike first before the Boltons can reinforce their allies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.22;The warmongery of House Stark finally knocks in our doors, its been centuries since the Wolf gave this barren and wartorn piece of shore to us, and since then we only suffered under their yoke, no more, with our Boltons allies we will drive the bloodthirsty direwolf back to its lair!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.22;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.222;Dark wings, dark words. A raven arrivied from the White Knife, House Stark finally decided to march on their unruly offshoot, this is the chance we been waiting, the andal invasion is over and we need no more meddling from Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.222;Call the Banners;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2222;The White Knife once again falls under the Stark banner, and with it our control over the North solidify, its true that rebellion stirred first close at home, but it was reinforced by House Bolton, which was permitted to keep most of its dominions and titles once they submited, but, now its clear that was a mistake, our troops will need to endure another campaing if there is to be peace in the North.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2222;Maybe we should style ourselfs King in the North...;;;;;;;;;x
dreadfort_subjugation;We march to the Dreadfort!;;;;;;;;;x
